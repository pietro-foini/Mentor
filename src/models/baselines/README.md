# Baselines

In order to achieve a thorough assessment of the architectureâ€™s performance, we test the model against several classical machine learning algorithms.
In more depth, we compare the proposed model against logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), 
boosting methods (XGBoost) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
